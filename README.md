The following research analyzes a dataset from the banking industry to predict the churn rate of current and past customers the bank has had. An Artificial Neural Network Model programmed in Python is utilized to carry out the predictions and the accuracy is calculated.

The experimental results, proportion of customers that have exited and retained, probability density of bank balance, correlation between attributes, top three factors responsible for churn, are all plotted in the form of a variety of graphs. 

Python libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn were used for creating the plots. Furthermore, the confusion matrix is calculated along with plotting graphs for the experimental results. Through this research we aim to highlight a model which can be utilized by financial organizations to better track their customer churn patterns.
